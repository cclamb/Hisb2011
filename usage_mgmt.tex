\begin{abstract}
Electronic medical record management is under new scruitiny as private companies move into the market and government agencies actively address percieved health care distribution inequalities and inefficiencies.  Current systems are coarse-grained and provide consumers very little actual control over their data.  Herein, we propose an alternative system for managing the use of healthcare infomormation.  This system is more granular, allows for data mining and repackaging, and gives users more control over data while allowing said data to be distributed as much as needed.  In this paper, we outline the characteristics of such a system, present relavant background information and research leading to the system design, and cover two specific use scenarios supported by this system that are difficult to control using simpler access control strategies.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
New healthcare legislation has spurred previously unknown levels of public and private investment into technologies supporting more efficient healthcare delivery \cite{website:recovery}.   An active area of examination is electronic health records.  Current systems, like Microsoft HealthVault and Google Health are a start in this area, but provide rudimentary control over health information, provide consumers with very little actual control of their information, and essentially demand proprietary lockin to these products because of the amount of effort involved with data transfer \cite{Evaluation:HealthInf:10}.

We propose an open, consumer-centric approach to health information storage and consumption centered around flexible and granular usage management policies.  User empowering systems in this area are needed to allow users control over the information that represents them, and would be in high demand if appropriately designed \cite{Emr:PyAmWaCr:04}.  We propose to address this need by bundling health information (either entire records or subsets of records) with traceable and aggregateable usage policies controlled by the users themselves.  Users would have the ability to make aspects of their records available to everyone from research institutions looking for historical information for studies, to specific healthcare providers who need specific information to support diagnoses.  Furthermore, institutions would be able to combine information from groups of users and determine dynamically via policy evaluation how that new set of data can be used in a way that complies with all included user policies.  If the combined dataset cannot be used, policies can be analyzed to determine the cause of the policy conflict.

We will propose, design, and demonstrate a system that supports granular management of the data elements of an electronic medical record.  This management will allow users to specify policies over the data itself rather than the entire record in question, providing control over information dissemination.  We will demonstrate this control in three distinct scenarios.  The first will include two distinct parties negotiating over access to specific information contained in a medical record.  If the parties can reach an agreement, the information consumer will be granted access to specific medical data, for an agreed-upon price.  The second demostrates a data broker combining a set of previously acquired medical record data into an aggregate set for research, if the licensure is in fact compliant between all selelected data elements.  Finally, the aggregated data set will be placed back into the market.

This kind of system, allowing users control over their data in ways fostering ease of dissemination, use and reuse, helps users receive better, more targed care, helps providers easly access required information, and allows this kind of data to be more easily examined and mined.  We use established system design principles, used in the develoment of internet-scale networks to create a open flexible system \cite{Al:04,BlCl:01,ClWrSoBr:02}.  We will standardize certain features, such as operational semantics and ontological domains, but otherwise limit the impact of the policy system on data dissemination as much as possible.

\subsection{Previous Work}
Past research applicable to this area includes usage management, digital rights management (DRM), and access control.  Most of the research applicable to the combination of previous arfifacts into a single aggregate artifact comes from the DRM world in particular.  Generally, these expressive languages have been fundamentally based on different types of mathematical logic or formalisms with reasoning capabilities \cite{ArHu:07,BaMi:06,ChCoEtHaJoLa:03,HaWe:04,HaWe:08,PuWe:02,XiBjFu:08}.  This approach, while useful in closed systems, tends to not work as usefully in more open dynamic environments.  This has led to the development of translation mechanisms to address interoperability needs \cite{HeJa:05,PoPrDe:04,ScTaWo:04}.  This translation process is difficult for most policy languages, and in fact infeasible as a result \cite{KoLaMaMi:04,SaShUe:04}.  Alternative approaches have required the use of sophiticated and powerful languages that must be adopted as a universal standard \cite{OMADRM,ODRL-req,Wa:04,XrML-spec}.  This approach inherently limits innovation and flexibility \cite{HeJa:05,JaHe:04,JaHe:08,JaHeMa:06}.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
